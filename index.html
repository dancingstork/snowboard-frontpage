    <p class="section_one-text">Snowboarding is a recreational and competitive activity that involves descending a snow-covered surface while standing
    on a snowboard that is almost always attached to a rider's feet. It features in the Winter Olympic Games and Winter
    Paralympic Games.</p>
    <p class="section_one-text">
    Snowboarding was developed in the United States, inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing, and skiing. It became
    popular around the globe, and was introduced as a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and featured in the Winter
    Paralympics at Sochi in 2014. As of 2015, its popularity (as measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked
    in 2007 and has been in a decline since.</p>
